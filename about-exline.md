XELINE is a smart wallet which acts as a command center, enabling an easy streamlined creation and monitoring of arbitrary tasks and their rewards. This is achieved by using the various components of the system while supplying a user friendly interface.  

The XEL network is functioning very well, yet it was never easy to interact with this complex system. Until now. We have developed Xeline, a wallet software which bundles the epitome of XEL’s features in one single easy-to-use command center, so you can focus on the most fun part: coding!

Xeline is a wallet aimed at the task programmer to conveniently submit his tasks to the XEL network, monitor the task execution, and easily analyze the results that were found by the nodes. The left-hand side presents the user with a detailed view of the most important parameters of XEL. Since you have to pay for the execution of your tasks, you see your balance which you can top up or withdraw from. To get you started fast, a faucet is integrated. Additionally, you see the computation power graph showing you an estimate of the network’s cumulative processing power and the number of open/closed tasks.
